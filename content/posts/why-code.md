As a kid, I was pretty good at school. Didn't have to try to hard in math or
science, I loved reading, and I was athletic enough to be competetive in sports.
Even learning about history was interesting and fun. But there was one class
I can remember hating even as early as 4th grade: **art**.

I was terrible at coloring, drawing, painting, sculpting, pottery, you name it.
Art was consistently the class that I got the worst grades in, but I accepted
this about myself pretty early on. For the most part I think this is totally
fine, everybody isn't good at everything! And I felt like if I wanted to, I
could probably practice more and get better. Just wasn't that important to me.

But the problem I didn't realize until later was that this lack of natural
artistic talent came to mean that I wasn't a "creative person". I didn't see
myself capable of making new things. And that's a problem because...
I kinda wanted to!

```rust {file="content/example.md"}
async fn main() -> Result<String> {
   println!("Hello World!");
}
```
